                        <p class="card-text">The Ragdoll is docile breed with a floppy calm nature. Known
                            for their distinct blue eyes and silky smooth fur, these cats
                            are simply beautiful to look at. Ragdolls are known to go limp
                            In your arms when holding them and hence the name they
                            have been given. Due to the docility of the breed they should
                            remain indoors because they may not be able to defend 
                            themselves. And who would want to lose such a beautiful 
                            pet anyway?

                        <p class="card-text">We breed both show cats and simple house pet cats. Our
                            Decision of which kittens are for show and which are for
                            house pets comes from years of experience and a 
                            knowledge of what is needed to win at any show. Our cats
                            have won multiple awards and prizes. Having a grand 
                            champion as a show cat is a rewarding but demanding
                            experience. House pets are simple, fun and just as rewarding
                            without the demand for so much work.

                            have won many shows. The difference is only the minor details not suited for show cats. A 
                            simple birthmark or color pattern and even size is what dictates our decision. our house cats are free birth defects 
                            and will always be the same quality as our show cats minus the show aspect. You can certainly show our house cats 
                            but it is not recommended for success.

                    <h3>The Common cat (mixed)</h3>
                    <p>While the common cat or a cat that is not purebred,
                        can make a great pet, the difference in personality is 
                        clearly visible. Comparing a common cat to a Ragdoll is just not justified in any way. The Ragdoll is a lovable pet that demands attention and caring. Any purebred cat has a noticeable difference than a mixed breed, but the Ragdoll is known for its docility and attention seeking behavior. Our Ragdolls are a perfect fit for any family or home. The price of a common cat or mixed breed is normally in this price range. Many have bad reputations due to aggressive behavior or scratching even the owner. This is not a concern with Ragdolls.</p>

                    <p>The show cat is just that, a cat for show but also a house pet. Any show cat requires lots of love and maintenance. Show cats require special attention and can be very rewarding for the owners willing to put in the time and effort required to win shows. Our show cats are the most expensive we offer because they are purebred from our grand champions. We hand select the best kittens suited for show, and with the required time and effort you are sure to experience many wins at your shows. Show cats are for serious cat show competitors, and well worth the money. They are just beautiful to look at.</p>

                    <p>The house cat makes a great gift companion. While these are just as beautiful and loving as the show cat, these house pets donâ€™t require nearly as much time and maintenance. We hand select the kittens for house pets based on color pattern and details that would rule out a show cat. These are kittens are also bred from champions but may have an undesirable birthmark or color pattern that would hinder show performance. Still the same lovable beautiful Ragdoll but less expensive. Our house kittens can be used for show but not recommended.</p>
