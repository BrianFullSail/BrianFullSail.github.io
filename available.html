                    <p>While the common cat or a cat that is not purebred,
                        can make a great pet, the difference in personality is 
                        clearly visible. Comparing a common cat to a Ragdoll is just not justified in any way. The Ragdoll is a lovable pet that demands attention and caring. Any purebred cat has a noticeable difference than a mixed breed, but the Ragdoll is known for its docility and attention seeking behavior. Our Ragdolls are a perfect fit for any family or home. The price of a common cat or mixed breed is normally in this price range. Many have bad reputations due to aggressive behavior or scratching even the owner. This is not a concern with Ragdolls.</p>

                    <p>The show cat is just that, a cat for show but also a house pet. Any show cat requires lots of love and maintenance. Show cats require special attention and can be very rewarding for the owners willing to put in the time and effort required to win shows. Our show cats are the most expensive we offer because they are purebred from our grand champions. We hand select the best kittens suited for show, and with the required time and effort you are sure to experience many wins at your shows. Show cats are for serious cat show competitors, and well worth the money. They are just beautiful to look at.</p>

We hand select the kittens for house pets based on color pattern and details that would rule out a show cat. These are kittens are also bred from champions but may have an undesirable birthmark or color pattern that would hinder show performance. Still the same lovable beautiful Ragdoll but less expensive.
